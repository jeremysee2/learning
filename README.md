# Learning FreeRTOS and C

This is a compilation of the notes that I am making to record useful details about FreeRTOS and C that I may want to refer to in the future for a quick refresher. This is in the context of programming the ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework, which is written in C and uses the FreeRTOS for scheduling tasks.

The C knowledge is taken from various online tutorials (mainly Harvard's CS50) and the FreeRTOS knowledge is taken from the official handbook, Chapter 3 onwards.
